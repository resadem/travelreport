<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack B2B travel portal based on FastAPI, React, and MongoDB, progressively implementing and refining features as per user feedback. The process was highly iterative, starting from clarifying core requirements, integrating a custom color palette and branding, and building the initial page structure. A significant portion of the work involved extensive frontend debugging, particularly addressing compilation errors,  and  issues in Shadcn UI's  components, and ensuring correct data formatting (dates, prices) and display (striped tables, payment badges). Backend enhancements supported new data models for suppliers and tourists and refined payment logic. The agent demonstrated resilience in fixing bugs, often through multiple attempts and targeted file manipulations (e.g.,  commands for bulk replacements), and is currently focused on optimizing the application for mobile responsiveness.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a bilingual (RU default, EN optional) B2B portal for a travel wholesaler (Admin) and sub-agencies (clients).
**Purpose:** Sub-agencies view their reservations, payments, and outstanding balances. Admin manages sub-agencies and reservations.
**Roles & Access:** Admin has full CRUD, seeing all columns. Sub-agencies have read-only access to their reservations, *excluding* 5 admin-only columns (supplier, supplier price, prepayment to supplier, revenue, revenue percentage), enforced at API level.
**Auth:** Email + password. Admin can create/disable sub-agency accounts.
**Pages:** Login, Reservations (Dashboard with filters, sort, pagination, export), Reservation Details (read-only for sub-agency, edit for admin), Sub-Agencies (CRUD users), Settings (upcoming due threshold).
**Payment UX:** Computed , badges (, , , ), and â€” for empty dates.
**Data Model:** User, Reservation, Supplier, Tourist.
**Current Build State:** The core portal is functional. Features implemented include a login page, a dashboard displaying reservations with filtering/pagination, detailed reservation view (with Mark as Paid for admin), sub-agency management (with phone number and editable email), supplier and tourist management pages (with detailed tourist form including country selection). The UI adheres to custom color palettes, displays prices without decimals in Rubles, and formats dates as dd.mm.yyyy. Table rows are striped, and select box errors have been resolved. Export to XLSX is functional.

<code_architecture>

-   : Main FastAPI app defining API for Auth, Users, Reservations, Suppliers, Tourists, Settings. It includes MongoDB models (User, Reservation, Supplier, Tourist), CRUD operations, RBAC, payment status calculation, and data serialization. Recent changes involve adding  and  models, updating  model with a  field, and refining  logic to correctly adjust amounts and dates.
-   : Environment variables for database URL, name, CORS, and .
-   : Configures React routing, integrating new pages (, ) and the  component for notifications.
-    and : Define global styles and integrate a custom color palette, ensuring consistent branding.
-   : Entry point for the frontend; updated with 4Travels B2B Portal title and favicon link.
-   : Contains various logo assets (, , ) and  for branding.
-   : Provides the application's overall structure, including a header with a logo, language switcher, user menu, and main navigation. It has been updated to include new menu items and to begin implementing mobile responsiveness features.
-   : Handles user authentication and displays the login form with branding.
-   : The central reservations list. It supports filtering, sorting, pagination, displays payment statuses, and exports data to XLSX. Significant updates include correcting  errors, implementing currency (Ruble) and date (dd.mm.yyyy) formatting, enabling striped table rows, and fixing general select box issues.

-   : Admin page to configure upcoming due threshold.
-   : New page for Admin to manage supplier data.
-   : New page for Admin to manage tourist profiles, featuring a detailed form for personal, passport, and contact information with a country select box. Select box issues were resolved.
-    and : Manage internationalization, providing translations for UI elements.
-   : Contains utility functions, notably  and , to ensure consistent data presentation across the application.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently addressing the user's request to enhance the application's mobile responsiveness. This involves:
1.  **Hamburger Menu**: Implementing a top-level hamburger menu for mobile navigation.
2.  **Profile Avatar**: Adding a profile avatar within the profile menu.
3.  **Bottom Navigation**: Displaying all main menu items as icons in a bottom navigation bar for mobile.
4.  **Mobile Page Views**: Ensuring all existing pages render and function correctly on mobile devices.

The AI engineer has begun by modifying , which is the central component for the application's layout and navigation. The next step identified is checking for the  component in  UI, indicating an intention to use this component to create the mobile-friendly navigation drawer.

<optional_next_step>
Implement the hamburger menu using the  component, profile avatar, and bottom navigation with icons within  to ensure mobile responsiveness across all pages, then test.
