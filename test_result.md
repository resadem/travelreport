# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"

##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

      ✅ **TOP-UPS HISTORY BACKEND TESTING COMPLETE - ALL TESTS PASSED**
      
      **Comprehensive Testing Results (8/8 tests passed):**
      
      1. **Authentication Test** ✅
         - Admin login successful with admin@4travels.com / admin123
         - Proper 403 errors for unauthorized access to /api/topups
         - Sub-agency users correctly blocked from admin endpoints
      
      2. **Create Top-up Test** ✅
         - POST /api/users/{user_id}/topup-balance working correctly
         - Returns topup_id, new_balance, and topup_amount
         - Top-up records stored in MongoDB 'topups' collection
         - Balance updates correctly (tested with 5000 amount)
      
      3. **Get Top-ups History Test** ✅
         - GET /api/topups returns complete history
         - All required fields present: id, agency_id, agency_name, amount, type, date, created_at
         - Correctly sorted by created_at descending (most recent first)
         - Proper JSON structure and data types
      
      4. **Edit Top-up Test** ✅
         - PUT /api/topups/{topup_id} working correctly
         - Balance adjustments accurate (tested 3000→4000, balance increased by 1000)
         - Top-up record updated in database
         - User balance reflects changes immediately
      
      5. **Delete Top-up Test** ✅
         - DELETE /api/topups/{topup_id} working correctly
         - Balance decreased by top-up amount (tested -2000)
         - Top-up removed from history completely
         - No orphaned records in database
      
      6. **Edge Cases Test** ✅
         - Non-existent topup_id returns proper 404 errors
         - Both edit and delete handle invalid IDs correctly
         - Error responses properly formatted
      
      **Key Findings:**
      - All balance calculations are mathematically accurate
      - Top-up history persistence working correctly
      - Admin-only access properly enforced
      - Error handling robust for edge cases
      - Database operations atomic and consistent
      
      **Backend top-ups history implementation is production-ready.**
